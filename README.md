# Auto-encoder_based_Repetitive_Child_Hand_Movement_Pattern_Identification

Identification of unique patterns in repetitive hand move- ments is crucial for child behavior analysis. However, accuracy of ex- isting automated models are impeded due to lack of diversity in train- ing datasets. To address this constraint, the proposed novel model employs autoencoders to compress high-dimensional data and extract latent features, with a limited dataset. The learned features are subsequently clustered differentiating distinct behaviors. Despite using binary annotated datasets, our model successfully identified four distinct categories, shed- ding light on intriguing insights into patterns of child hand movements. Through statistical evaluations, our autoencoder demonstrates superior performance, achieving a mean reconstruction error of 0.003 and a mean Bayesian value of 0.112, surpassing other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further analysis of movement between the clusters revealed discernible patterns of transitioning from typical to atypical behavior. This research contributes to advancing automated analysis of child hand movement pattern analysis, providing healthcare professionals and researchers with an effective model to comprehend and address behavioral disorders in children.
